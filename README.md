Dog Tinder! 
Although this project was a little on the humorous side, it was also my final project at Dev-Academy. Within a week, myself and two others attempted to recreate tinder but for people who are wanting to socialise their dogs. 

We came up against many challenges specifically related to relational data, and managed to create a functioning application that matches users depending on who they like and dislike. We used Firebase to create a messaging system that allows users to get in touch with one another. 

A main issue we came across was how to determine who has liked who, and what profiles should be shown to the user according to their likes and dislikes. Our database functions were a main point of focus because of this. 

We are needing to update the css, as currently the project can only be viewed by selecting a phone layout in your browsers developer tools.
